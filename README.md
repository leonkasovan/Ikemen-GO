# Ikemen GO

Ikemen GO is an open source fighting game engine that supports resources from the [M.U.G.E.N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugen_(game_engine)) engine, written in Googleâ€™s programming language, [Go](https://go.dev/). It is a complete rewrite of a prior engine known simply as Ikemen.

## Features
Ikemen GO aims for backwards-compatibility on par with M.U.G.E.N version 1.1 Beta, while simultaneously expanding on its features in a variety of ways.

Refer to [our wiki](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki) to see a comprehensive list of new features that have been added in Ikemen GO.

## Installing
Ready to use builds for Windows, macOS and Linux can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/releases) of this repository. You can find nightly builds [here](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/releases/tag/nightly) as well, which update on every commit.

## Running
Download the ZIP archive that matches your operating system and extract its contents to your preferred location.

On Windows, double-click `Ikemen_GO.exe` (`Ikemen_GO_x86.exe` on 32-bit OSes).
On macOS or Linux, double-click `Ikemen_GO.command`.

## Developing
These instructions are for those interested in developing the Ikemen GO engine itself. Instructions for creating custom stages, fonts, characters and other resources can be found in the community forum.

### Building
You can find instructions for building Ikemen GO on our wiki. Instructions are available for [Windows](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Building,-Installing-and-Distributing#building-on-windows), [macOS](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Building,-Installing-and-Distributing#building-on-macos), and [Linux](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Building,-Installing-and-Distributing#building-on-linux).
